The Online Voting Platform project aims to create a secure and efficient system for conducting elections and gathering votes through an online platform. The system is designed to have two main user roles: the Voting Conductor and the Voter. The Voting Conductor manages the election details and user data, while the Voter logs in to cast their vote. The system ensures each voter can cast only one vote by tallying user data with the conductor's data.
